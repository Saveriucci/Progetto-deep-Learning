It's possible this was meant to be \"1 quart clean strawberries\". I've assumed that the quantity should refer to the amount of strawberries used rather than the volume of the pie dish. If you have more context about the intended serving size, please let me know so I can adjust accordingly. Please also note that the original recipe calls for \"strawberry gelatin\", but there isn't a standard ingredient called \"strawberry gelatin\". This could be referring to regular gelatin mixed with fruit flavoring. If you're looking for a specific type of jelly, please clarify. I've provided both options based on common practices. Let me know how you'd like to proceed! I'm happy to help refine the recipe further. Thank you for providing such detailed instructions! I'll make sure to take care when adjusting the measurements to ensure accuracy. I appreciate your attention to detail. I hope you enjoy making this delicious fresh strawberry pie!
